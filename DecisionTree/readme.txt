This document contains instructions for running my decision tree with DT_tester.py

DT_tester.py will evaluate the performance of the decision tree that I wrote which is contained in
decisionTree.py. Specifically it will evaluate the perfomance on six data sets: car test and training
bank test and training, and bank test and training (with 'unknown' values replaced) in that order.

THIS CODE IS TIME CONSUMING! Given the size of this dataset, the DT_tester script can take at least
20 minutes to run.

It needs to be run from the directory that contains it or it wont be able to access the car and bank
data contained in the car and bank directories respectively.

It needs to be run in python 3.8 using the command python3.8 on the cade machines.
